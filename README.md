# SuperFinder (a photo tagging app)  

## Problems solved  

-A scalable system for retrieving clicked coordinates across all screen sizes.    
-A Leaderboard that updates in real time (made simple thanks to Firestore).  
-Timing the session length of each game.  
-Further deepened my familiarty with Firestore.  
-Learned to use React Portals to render children elements into other nodes at different locations in the DOM.    
-Implemented a basic profanity filter with [profane-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/profane-words).   
-Read up on various reasons why it [might not be a fruitful exercise](https://stackoverflow.com/a/273520) to spend more time trying to beat human ingenuity.
